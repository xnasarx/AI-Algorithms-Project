# AI-Algorithms-Project
This project has the following models;
Imported Libraries
Visualized the data
Created the heatmap to check correlation
Cleaned the data
Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, KNN.
Saved the model into a package using Pickle
Used hyperparameter tuning for tuning for the Gradient Boosting because it was the best model.
